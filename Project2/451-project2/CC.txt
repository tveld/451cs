These are common commands for compiling certain test files instead of having to look them up all the time

I just want to copy paste them into the terminal don't ask me anything else.

to compile test cases use "javac -cp DLUnit.jar TestClass.java"
to run type "java -jar DLUnit.jar JLSFile.jls CompTest.class"

jlsCircuitTester circuitName.jls inputSetFile
